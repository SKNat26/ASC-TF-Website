                <p class="text">
                    A month ago, I wanted to find a new passion, specifically a musical one. After being inspired by the famous video of Amin Toofani playing his guitar, I ordered my first guitar. The guitar itself, a cheap beginner's guitar, isn't exceptional. However, what is exceptional is what I will be able to do with my guitar. With all the pressures of junior year and my extracurriculurs, I was unable to take guitar classes. So I decided to self-teach myself with the internet. My progress is slow, but it is progress nontheless.

My very first challenge was actually tuning the guitar and getting used to the strings and playing positions. It took about a day, but soon I could tune my guitar, sit in the correct position, and play a few notes with my pick.</p>

                            <p class="text">Using a free online program, I started my first official guitar lesson. This lesson was all about the D-Chord. To most guitarists, the D-Chord is child's-play, however since it was my first chord, it was quite difficult to learn it. My fingers started hurting and slipping out of position. It took a few days, but I got the hang of it.</p>

My next big challenge, however, was switching between the D-Chord and A-Chord while playing. At first, my switches were slow and inaccurate. Over the next week, with some practice, I was able to get decent switches between these two chords.</p>
