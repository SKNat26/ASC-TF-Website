                    A month ago, I wanted to find a new passion, specifically a musical one. After being inspired by the famous video of Amin Toofani playing his guitar, I ordered my first guitar. The guitar itself, a cheap beginner's guitar, isn't exceptional. However, what is exceptional is what I will be able to do with my guitar. With all the pressures of junior year and my extracurriculurs, I was unable to take guitar classes. So I decided to self-teach myself with the internet. My progress is slow, but it is progress nontheless.
